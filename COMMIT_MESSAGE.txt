Fix: Resolve variable indices correctly in sum(for ...) with nested generators

Problem:
--------
Constraints using sum(for ...) with nested generators (outer + inner) were
showing "0 <= 1" or "0 = 1" in LP output instead of proper variables.

Example of broken constraint:
  constraints([t <- teachers, m <- time_slots],
    sum(for s <- subjects, r <- rooms, do: schedule(t, s, r, m)) <= 1,
    "Teacher time conflict")

LP output showed: "Teacher_time_conflict_constraint: 0 <= 1"
Expected: "Teacher_time_conflict_constraint: 1 schedule(...) + ... <= 1"

Root Cause:
-----------
The issue was in variable index resolution in expression_parser.ex. When
parsing expressions like x(o, i) where o and i are generator variables:

1. AST contains atoms :o and :i as indices
2. Code tried Map.get(bindings, var, fallback) where fallback was || var
3. If not found, it returned the atom itself (:o or :i) instead of the value
4. Variable lookup then failed because it searched for x(:o, :i) instead of
   x("A", "X"), resulting in zero polynomials

Solution:
---------
Fixed index resolution to use Map.fetch/2 with proper error handling:

- Changed from: Map.get(bindings, var, Enum.find_value(...) || var)
- Changed to: Map.fetch(bindings, var) with {:ok, value} / :error handling

This ensures indices are resolved to actual values ("A", "X") instead of
atoms (:o, :i), allowing correct variable lookup.

Additional Improvements:
------------------------
- Enhanced error messages in sum_processing.ex to provide better debugging
  info when generator domains fail to evaluate
- Added try/rescue around domain evaluation to catch and report errors
  with context about environment and bindings

Impact:
-------
- Fixes school_timetabling.exs constraints (now show proper variables)
- Fixes all sum(for ...) expressions with nested generators
- Would also fix max()/min() if they support nested generators (same
  index resolution code path)
- No breaking changes - only fixes incorrect behavior

Testing:
--------
Created toy examples to verify the fix:
- test/toy_examples/toy_1_sum_for_issue.exs: Reproduces and verifies fix
- test/toy_examples/toy_5_fix_verification.exs: Tests school_timetabling pattern

All constraints in school_timetabling.exs now correctly include variables
in LP output.
